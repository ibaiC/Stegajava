Steganography tool capable of hiding text within images as well as images within other images. It is written in Java and may have some bugs when used with images and secrets of large sizes. It isn't perfect but it is a first attempt at diving a little deeper into steganography.

It uses the Least Significant Bit algorithm to store data and retrieve it from cover images.
